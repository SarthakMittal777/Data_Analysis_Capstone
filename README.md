# Population Recession Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for a data analysis project focused on studying population trends and potential recession indicators. In an era of changing demographics and economic uncertainties, understanding how population dynamics relate to economic recessions is crucial. This project aims to provide insights into this relationship through data analysis and visualization.

## Background

Population growth and economic performance are intricately linked. A decline in population growth can indicate a slowing economy, and an economic recession can lead to decreased birth rates and immigration. This project aims to explore this relationship by analyzing historical population data alongside economic indicators to identify potential patterns and correlations.

## Data

### Data Sources

- **Population Data**: We have collected population data from [source 1] and [source 2], which provides demographic information spanning several decades. This data includes population figures broken down by region, age group, and other relevant categories.

- **Economic Indicators**: Economic indicators such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, and inflation rates have been sourced from [source 3] and [source 4]. These indicators will be used to study their relationship with population trends.

### Data Preprocessing

Before analysis, the data undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and data quality issues. This ensures that the analysis is based on reliable data.

## Analysis

The analysis is divided into the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration**: We begin by exploring the population and economic data to gain a better understanding of their distributions and trends over time.

2. **Correlation Analysis**: We calculate correlations between population trends and economic indicators to identify any significant relationships.

3. **Time Series Analysis**: Time series analysis will be performed on both population and economic data to detect patterns, trends, and potential leading indicators of recession.

4. **Visualization**: We will create visualizations, including line plots, heatmaps, and scatter plots, to illustrate the relationships and patterns identified during the analysis.

## Results

The results of this analysis will be presented in the form of reports, visualizations, and insights. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how population dynamics are linked to economic recessions, including potential early warning signs.
